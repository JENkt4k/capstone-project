SavvyCoders Capstone Project

Definition of my audience: People who want to feel safe at outdoor events.

Purpose: I want to create a web application that provides safety in numbers and connections at outdoor events.

Sales Pitch: As someone who has no sense of direction, I use my phone quite a bit to get around. The trouble is, if I lose the group that I'm with, I may not be able to use my phone to track them. Now, as someone who goes to many concerts, art festivals, food truck events, etc., I tend to stray from the group easily. I am also someone who is concerned about my safety and others' in the community. I originally wanted to build this web application as a way to connect people, because in numbers, there is safety. As I continue to build on this project and grow, there is so much potential for what it's capable of. With this web application, I plan to bring people together and build a foundation of safety so people are able to connect and know where their loved ones are at any moment.

Outline of Content: Once a profile is created on the web application, the user should be able to search any local event in their area. Once an event is chosen, the user will be able to view the event they are going to and the web application will connect them with an event map that was submitted by the event organizer. Once the user is on this event map, they will be able to view any of their friends from the web application who are also at the event. The user will be able to connect to their friends through a "call" button, that pings their location to their friends at the event.
